# Synthesized-an-Image-Classification
We have synthesized an image-classification problem. Your goal is to build a classifier that can detect the class of an input image. 
We have collected images-data from different sources and combine them into this 1 file: gen_img_data.json.zip. Data is well-formatted and if analyzed carefully can help you fully grasp the problem.
